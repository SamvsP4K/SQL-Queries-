From Leetcode - https://leetcode.com/problems/fix-names-in-a-table/description

Problem:

Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Solution:

SELECT user_id,
CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(name,1,1)),LOWER(SUBSTR(name,2))) as name -- selects first letter and capitalizes with Upper(Substr()), Selects the rest of the word with Lower(Substr) and concatenates 
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
